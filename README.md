# UT-Backplane-mapping [![Build status](https://travis-ci.com/ZishuoYang/UT-Backplane-mapping.svg?master)](https://travis-ci.com/ZishuoYang)
Signal mapping netlist (list of pin-to-pin correspondence) formatted for Altium
to design the LHCb UT backplane.

* `AltiumNetlistGen.py`: This script takes 3 YAML files and write the
  reformatted list to `output/`.  All YAML files are located under `input/`;
  one of them describes connections from PT connectors point-of-view (`PT-
  DCB`); another from DCB; the third one includes break-out boards pin
  assignments.
* `NetlistCheck.py`: This scripts takes Altium-exported netlists (under
  `input/netlists`) and check if these netlists fully implements connections
  specified in the copy-paste lists generated by the script above.
* `FiberAsicMap.py`: This scripts take parsed netlists from
  `AltiumNetlistGen.py`, then use pre-defined PEPI structure in `pyUTM.common`
  to generate ASIC to fiber mapping in `output/`.


## Prerequisite
Install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r pyUTM/requirements.txt
```


## Usage
If only the copy-and-paste `.csv` are needed:
```
python ./AltiumNetlistGen.py
```

If additional error checking is required (note that this script would also
generate `.csv` files):
```
python ./NetlistCheck.py <path_to_netlist_file> <optional:log_filename>
```
if `<log_filename>` not provided, log will be generated under `log/`, with a
time-stamped filename of `NetlistCheck-<bp_type>-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.log`

If additional ASIC to fiber mapping generation is required:
```
python ./FiberAsicMap.py
```

All generated `.csv` files are located under `output/`.
These scripts print out warnings to `stdout`, and can be redirected as needed.
